# Contributing Guide

## Picking an Issue

Features are tracked via a [GitHub Issues Project](https://github.com/users/andrew-codes/projects/1/views/2). Feel free to pick any up that are not already assigned. If you aren't sure were to start, try looking at issues labeled as a "[good first issue](https://github.com/andrew-codes/forecast-work/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+)".

## Getting Started with Local Development

1. Pull code to local machine
2. Run `yarn` in repo root to install dependencies
3. Running `yarn start` will build and open the application for development.
