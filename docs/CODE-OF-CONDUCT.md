# Contributor Code of Conduct
Forecast believes that maintainers and contributors can work at their best in a friendly and open environment. 
Thus,Â we want to create a welcoming, harassment-free environment that values everyone who contributes to or wants to contribute to this project, 
regardless of their age, body type, disability, ethnicity, sex preferences, gender identity, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status,
nationality, physical appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

We also welcome participants from around the world with different experiences, unique perspectives, and great ideas to share.

- Attempting collaboration before conflict.
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our actions and mistakes, and learning from the experience.
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals but for the community.
