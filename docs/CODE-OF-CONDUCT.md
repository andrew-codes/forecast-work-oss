# Contributor Code of Conduct
Forecast believes that maintainers and contributors can work at their best in a friendly and open environment. 
Thus,Â we want to create a welcoming, harassment-free environment that values everyone who contributes to or wants to contribute to this project, 
regardless of their age, body type, disability, ethnicity, sex preferences, gender identity, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status,
nationality, physical appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

We also welcome participants from around the world with different experiences, unique perspectives, and great ideas to share.

## Our Standards

We can build a welcoming and inclusive community if we adopt these behaviours:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, perspectives, viewpoints and experiences.
- Giving and accepting constructive feedback.
- Attempting collaboration before conflict.
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our actions and mistakes, and learning from the experience.
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals but for the community.
- Showing empathy towards everyone.

These behaviours  are, however, considered unacceptable:
- Using violence, threats of violence, or inciting others to commit self-harm or harm unto others.
- Using sexualized language or imagery and initiating any unwanted sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, intentionally spreading misinformation, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing confidential and private information of others, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.
- Unethical or unprofessional conduct.
- Abuse of the reporting process to intentionally harass or exclude others.

# Enforcement and reporting guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behaviour or have any other concerns, please notify one of the community maintainers or [Andrew Smith](https://github.com/andrew-codes) as soon as possible. We will review and investigate every complaint. We shall use our discretion to decide when and how to respond to reported incidents, with options ranging from taking no action to banning someone permanently from the project and spaces sponsored by the project. You should also know the community maintainer is obligated to maintain confidentiality concerning the reporter of an incident. 

However, before taking further action, we will inform the accused of the report and give them a chance to speak about it. But in potentially dangerous situations, such as persistent harassment or threats to anyone's safety, we will take action without prior notice.

This also applies to maintainers who do not follow the Code of Conduct.
